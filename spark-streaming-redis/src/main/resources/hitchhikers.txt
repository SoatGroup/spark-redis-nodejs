Love isn�t a decision, it�s a feeling.
If we could decide who to love,
then,
life would be much simpler,
but then less magical.




*****************



I want to tell this to you.
You are my heart and my soul too.
I can�t live a day without you.
My feeling cannot be expressed in words.
I love you so much my dearest queen..!!




*****************



Don't fall in love with someone you can live with, fall in love with the one you can't live without.



*****************

heart it is you

*****************



I realized it today I will love you forever
Even if you love me never
I love you I really know,
Because it's so hard to let go




*****************



Life Depends On Love, Love Depends On
Trust, Trust Depends On Heart, Heart
Depends On Only You . .




*****************



In God?s eyes, Love is never absent.
In God?s heart, forgiveness is never impossible.
In God?s embrace, no one is ever alone or forgotten.




*****************



love is not how u 4get but how u forgive.
not how u listen but how u understand.
not what u see but what u feel
& not how u let go but how u hold on.

we realize that woundedknees n broken toys were

better than wounded emotions n broken hearts...........

i saw you then as I see you now Through love's impassioned blindness,
A heart so fashioned there within Filled with love and kindness.

The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
Douglas Adams
for
Jonny Brock and Clare Gorst
and all other Arlingtonians
for tea, sympathy, and a sofa
Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the western spiral arm of the Galaxy
lies a small unregarded yellow sun.
Orbiting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an utterly insignificant little blue green
planet whose ape-descended life forms are so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a
pretty neat idea.
This planet has - or rather had - a problem, which was this: most of the people on it were unhappy for
pretty much of the time. Many solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were largely
concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper, which is odd because on the whole it wasn't
the small green pieces of paper that were unhappy.
And so the problem remained; lots of the people were mean, and most of them were miserable, even the
ones with digital watches.
Many were increasingly of the opinion that they'd all made a big mistake in coming down from the trees
in the first place. And some said that even the trees had been a bad move, and that no one should ever have
left the oceans.
And then, one Thursday, nearly two thousand years after one man had been nailed to a tree for saying
how great it would be to be nice to people for a change, one girl sitting on her own in a small cafe in
Rickmansworth suddenly realized what it was that had been going wrong all this time, and she finally knew
how the world could be made a good and happy place. This time it was right, it would work, and no one
would have to get nailed to anything.
Sadly, however, before she could get to a phone to tell anyone about it, a terribly stupid catastrophe
occurred, and the idea was lost forever.
This is not her story.
But it is the story of that terrible stupid catastrophe and some of its consequences.
It is also the story of a book, a book called The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy - not an Earth book,
never published on Earth, and until the terrible catastrophe occurred, never seen or heard of by any Earthman.
Nevertheless, a wholly remarkable book.
in fact it was probably the most remarkable book ever to come out of the great publishing houses of
Ursa Minor - of which no Earthman had ever heard either.
Not only is it a wholly remarkable book, it is also a highly successful one - more popular than the
Celestial Home Care Omnibus, better selling than Fifty More Things to do in Zero Gravity, and more
controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters Where God Went Wrong, Some
More of God's Greatest Mistakes and Who is this God Person Anyway?
In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitch Hiker's
Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge 
and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly
inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects.
First, it is slightly cheaper; and secondly it has the words Don't Panic inscribed in large friendly letters
on its cover.
But the story of this terrible, stupid Thursday, the story of its extraordinary consequences, and the
story of how these consequences are inextricably intertwined with this remarkable book begins very
simply.
It begins with a house.
